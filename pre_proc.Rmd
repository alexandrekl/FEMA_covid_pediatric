load data from HHS - COVID-19 Reported Patient Impact and Hospital Capacity by Facility
https://healthdata.gov/Hospital/COVID-19-Reported-Patient-Impact-and-Hospital-Capa/anag-cw7u
The following dataset provides facility-level data for hospital utilization aggregated on a weekly basis (Friday to Thursday). These are derived from reports with facility-level granularity across two main sources: (1) HHS TeleTracking, and (2) reporting provided directly to HHS Protect by state/territorial health departments on behalf of their healthcare facilities.

```{r}
facility <- read.csv('data/COVID-19_Reported_Patient_Impact_and_Hospital_Capacity_by_Facility.csv')
```

Aggregate by state
```{r}
state <- facility %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  summarise()
```
